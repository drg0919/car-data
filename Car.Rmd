## Understanding Gas Mileage

We use the `mtcars` data set , and using that, we can make a plot to infer the relationship of various factors on mileage (`mpg`).

First, we will plot weight (`wt`) vs mileage (`mpg`) along x/y axes. Then, we will visualise number of cylinders (`cyl`) as colours and the horsepower (`hp`) as an individual point in the plot we obtained.

## Visualizing the Data

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl), size = ~hp,
        text = ~paste("Weight: ", wt, '<br>MpG:', mpg),
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Cars' data")
```
